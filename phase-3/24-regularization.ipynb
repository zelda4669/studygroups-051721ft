    "## Ridge and Lasso\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge and Lasso regression are two examples of penalized estimation. Penalized estimation makes some or all of the coefficients smaller in magnitude (closer to zero). Some of the penalties have the property of performing both variable selection (setting some coefficients exactly equal to zero) and shrinking the other coefficients. \n",

    "\n",
    "Lasso regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is very similar to Ridge regression, except that the magnitude of the coefficients are not squared in the penalty term.\n",

    "So we're penalizing large coefficients -- what are the effects/implications of that?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardization before Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "An important step before using either Lasso or Ridge regularization is to first standardize your data such that it is all on the same scale. Regularization is based on the concept of penalizing larger coefficients, so **if you have features that are on different scales, some will get unfairly penalized**. A downside of standardization is that the value of the coefficients become less interpretable and must be transformed back to their original scale if you want to interpret how a one unit change in a feature impacts the target variable.\n",
